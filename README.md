# Multivariate Linear Regression Models

This repository contains implementations and experiments with **Multivariate Linear Regression** as part of the *Statistical Analysis* course at **Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)**.

The project focuses on:
- Evaluating **model fit**.
- Practical coding with datasets from **Kaggle**.
- Detailed discussion on **multiple linear regression**.
